# Hi, I'm Lisa! This is my Maiden Voyage on GitHubüíÉüèº
## I'm currently enrolled in a FEWD 1 class. This is my first time using GitHub and first post. Exciting times!

I have decades of experience as a creative professional who excels at educating, and producing compelling communications, recommending comprehensive strategies, and delivering superior integrated solutions. 

I am passionate about approaching projects holistically focusing on how I can bring elevated experiences with my colleagues, projects, and clients to be optimally successful. Keeping output quality, team engagement and the deadline top of mind.

I‚Äôm currently in an FEWD 1 class, so I am new to programming. I‚Äôm taking this opportunity to expand my skills to reveal if I have any talent with programming or at least the experience will allow me to deepen my understanding and interactions with programmers. I‚Äôm so excited to see where it takes me next!
